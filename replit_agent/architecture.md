## Data Flow

### User Registration and Authentication

1. Users register through the web interface or via API
2. Account verification is performed via email confirmation
3. Authentication is handled via session cookies for web users or JWT tokens for API access
4. Role-based permissions control access to various system functions

### Payment Processing Flow

1. User initiates a payment through web interface or API
2. Payment is validated and recorded in the database
3. Depending on the payment type, it is routed to the appropriate payment gateway or financial institution
4. For blockchain settlements, transactions are sent to the appropriate smart contract
5. Transaction status is updated in real-time and notifications are sent to relevant parties
6. Payment receipts and confirmations are generated as needed

### Blockchain Integration Flow

1. Smart contracts (Settlement, MultiSig, Token) are deployed to the Ethereum network
2. Transaction requests involving blockchain are routed to the blockchain service
3. The service creates and signs Ethereum transactions using user or admin private keys
4. Transactions are submitted to the blockchain and monitored for confirmation
5. Transaction results are recorded in the database and reported back to users

### Inter-institutional Transfer Flow

1. User initiates a transfer to another financial institution
2. System determines the optimal routing path (SWIFT, ACH, RTGS, blockchain)
3. Appropriate message formats are generated based on the destination institution
4. Messages are transmitted over secure channels to the recipient institution
5. Confirmation messages are processed and recorded
6. Transaction status is updated and notifications are sent
