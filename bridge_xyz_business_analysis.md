## Recommended Partnership Structure

Based on this analysis, we recommend restructuring our partnership approach with Bridge.xyz to include:

1. **Baseline Fee Structure**:
   - Maintain tiered transaction fee model (0.40% → 0.30% → 0.25%)
   - Adjust revenue share to 65/35 (NVC/Bridge) to provide Bridge more incentive

2. **Performance Acceleration**:
   - Add automatic fee reductions when quarterly volumes exceed targets by 20%+
   - Create "Milestone Bonuses" that unlock at specific total volume thresholds

3. **Strategic Alignment**:
   - 2-year exclusivity period where NVCT uses Bridge.xyz as primary off-ramp
   - Co-development of at least two new features annually
   - Quarterly strategic alignment sessions between leadership teams

4. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Clearly defined SLAs with financial penalties for non-performance
   - Joint compliance committee to address regulatory challenges
   - Shared security and fraud prevention protocols

This revised structure creates stronger alignment by:
- Giving Bridge.xyz more skin in the game via the adjusted revenue share
- Creating mutual benefits for exceeding performance targets
- Establishing a strategic rather than purely transactional relationship
- Building shared accountability for success and risk management

## Next Steps

1. Request Bridge.xyz's standard partnership agreement to understand their baseline expectations
2. Prepare a revised partnership term sheet incorporating these alignment principles
3. Schedule an executive alignment session to discuss strategic objectives beyond financial terms
4. Develop a 90-day implementation plan with clear milestones and responsibilities
