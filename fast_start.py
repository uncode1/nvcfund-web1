"""
Fast Startup Script for NVC Banking Platform

This script implements various optimizations to dramatically improve startup time
and overall performance of the application.

Key optimizations:
1. Disable unnecessary services during development
2. Lazy loading of resources
3. In-memory caching of frequently accessed data
4. Database connection pooling and optimization
5. Asynchronous loading of secondary resources
